# Dockerfiles

I have some dockerfiles, hopefully the names make it self evident what they are. Some of their folders have a README with more info. Mostly for personal need after not finding exactly what I needed on Dockerhub.

- [diginc/pipenv-goodies on docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/diginc/pipenv-goodies)
- [diginc/debian-terraform-aws on docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/diginc/debian-terraform-aws)
